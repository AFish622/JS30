    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'austin'
    console.log(players, team)
    // if you update an array it will always reference back

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // if you take slice and pass no arguements it makesa copy of an array

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const newPerson = person;
    // newPerson.number = 99;

    //makes a reference to the original person
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99})
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const austin = {
      name: 'austin',
      age: 29,
      social: {
        facebook: 'austinfisher',
        ig: 'vote4austin'
      }
    }

    const devAustin = Object.assign({}, austin)

    //poor mans deep clone
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(austin))
    // converts object to a string and then immediatly turns in back into a object so you can clone deep.
